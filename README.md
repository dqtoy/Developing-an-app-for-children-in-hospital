# Developing-an-app-for-children-in-hospital
Play is an important part of childhood development, but children who are unwell may have fewer opportunities to do so. The purpose of this project cluster is to develop an iPad app suitable for children who are hospital patients so that they can have fun, stretch their imaginations, relax, escape, be creative and reach out to friends  We have a prototype app and art assets developed by a team at Moray House School of Education and Sport and Edinburgh College of Art. During this project, the group of students will extend the app to include a range of additional games and interactive creativity tools which all fit around a central theme and characters (including Lolly the Space Sheep). Students will decide which age group they wish to target; decide which type of play they wish to support; design the user experience and interface; implement their design within the existing code base; evaluate their app with children. The flexible structure will enable each student to have a unique project while still working in a team. An iterative user centred design process will be used, with healthy children as co-designers.
